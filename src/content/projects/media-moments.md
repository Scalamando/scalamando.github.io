description: As a contributor to the 'Meetup of Media Informatics 2024,' I conceptualized and brought to life the Media Moments web app. This application empowers pedestrians to connect with the projects crafted by first-semester media informatics students. Navigating the city of Lübeck, users can explore an interactive map pinpointing various project locations. The app seamlessly integrates with the physical world, allowing users to unlock exclusive content by simply scanning the QR code at each project site.
