## Disclaimer

### Liability for Content

The content of my pages has been created with the utmost care. However, I
cannot guarantee the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the content. As
a service provider, I am responsible for our own content on these pages
according to § 7 Abs.1 TMG. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, I am not obligated
as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored third-party information
or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to
remove or block the use of information under general laws remain unaffected.
However, liability in this regard is only possible from the time of knowledge
of a specific legal violation. Upon becoming aware of corresponding legal
violations, I will remove these contents immediately.

### Liability for Links

This site contains links to external websites of third parties, the content of
which I have no influence over. Therefore, I cannot assume any liability for
these external contents. The respective provider or operator of the pages is
always responsible for the contents of the linked pages. The linked pages were
checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal content
was not recognizable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of
the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of
a violation of the law. Upon becoming aware of legal violations, I will remove
such links immediately.

### Copyright

The content and works created by the site operator on these pages are subject
to German copyright law. The reproduction, processing, distribution, and any
kind of exploitation beyond the limits of copyright require the written consent
of the respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of this page are only
permitted for private, non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this page
was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected.
In particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you nevertheless
become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform me accordingly. Upon
becoming aware of legal violations, I will remove such content immediately.

### Data Protection

The use of my website is generally possible without providing personal data.
To the extent that personal data (e.g., name, address, or email addresses) is
collected on our pages, this is always done on a voluntary basis, if possible.
This data will not be disclosed to third parties without your express consent.
We point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., communication by
email) may have security vulnerabilities. A complete protection of the data
against access by third parties is not possible. The use of contact data
published in the context of the imprint obligation by third parties for sending
unsolicited advertising and information materials is hereby expressly
prohibited. The operator of the pages expressly reserve the right to take
legal action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising
information, for example through spam emails.
